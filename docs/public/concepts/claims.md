# Claims

A claim says who's working on a path right now, and for how long: a lease, not a lock. It's a courtesy signal between people and agents sharing a vault, not an access gate. Claiming a path never stops anyone from writing it, and writing a path never needs a claim first: what actually guards a write from overwriting someone else's change is its own version check (see [Vaults, files and folders](vaults-and-files.md)).

**Usable both ways.** An agent claims, renews, releases and lists claims over MCP (`claim_path`, `renew_claim`, `release_claim`, `list_claims`). Only a person, in the web app, breaks someone else's claim: the same ceiling as approving a proposal or revealing a variable's value.

## How a claim works

Claiming a path leases it to you for a while, today 48 hours by default. You can ask for less; asking for more is simply capped at the default, not refused. Checking in (renewing) restarts the lease, so working steadily never loses your claim. If nothing checks in, the claim expires on its own the next time anyone tries to claim that path: nothing has to notice or clean it up.

No amount of checking in holds a claim past its hold limit, seven days from when it was first granted. Past that, release it and claim again.

A claim carries an optional label, whatever you're doing ("rewriting the intro"), shown to people on the vault's Claims page. It's just a note someone wrote: never trust it to say who's really holding the claim.

## Claiming a path (agents)

An agent that's about to work on a path claims it first, so another agent (or the same person's other agent) sees it's taken. `claim_path` returns a secret, once: the agent holds onto it, along with the fence number the response also returns, to renew or release that same claim later. Trying to claim an already-claimed path is refused, naming who holds it and when it frees up.

Whoever could write a path can claim it; a read-only connection can't. One active claim per connection, and five across one person's agents, in a vault.

## Seeing and breaking claims (people)

Every vault has a **Claims** section listing who's claimed what, and how much longer. An owner or editor can **Break** someone else's claim there, after a confirm page: it frees the path right away, for anyone to claim next. Breaking a claim changes nothing about the file itself; it's logged in [Activity](activity.md), the same as granting, renewing or releasing one.

## Export, delete and erase

Claims are state, not content: deleting a vault clears its claims along with everything else, and erasing a file's content releases any claim on it, since a claim on content that no longer exists means nothing. Neither is exported: see [Export, delete and erase](export-delete-erase.md).
